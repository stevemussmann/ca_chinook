If you install Eric Anderson's version of the [mega-simple-microhap-snakeflow](https://github.com/eriqande/mega-simple-microhap-snakeflow) pipeline on your computer, replace `mega-simple-microhap-snakeflow/workflow/script
/create_microhaplot_folder.R` with the file of the same name contained in this folder.

This is not necessary if you install the version from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/stevemussmann/mega-simple-microhap-snakeflow) because this change is already incorporated.
